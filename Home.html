				Modern Linux is available in a large (200+) number of distributions, or 'distros.' Many are fine-tuned for special uses, such as education, servers, mathematics, scientific applications, and, perhaps most popular, desktop applications. You can do almost anything using Linux that you can do on a proprietary (i.e., Windows or Mac) operating system: office applications - word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, photo editing, web browsing, video and audio editing, games, software development (Linux supports modern languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java). Most of the world's web servers are Linux-based (Apache2 and Nginx). Anyone who uses an Android-based smartphone is already using Linux (often without even being aware of it!). Almost all of the embedded computing (car computers, for example) world (the Internet of Things) is also Linux-based.
